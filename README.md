##  Projects  
-  [**Car Image Classification with EfficientNet & Meta Features**]((https://github.com/Sungi-Hwang/Carclassification)
   End-to-end image classification pipeline built for a Korean car classification competition.  
   Utilized **EfficientNet-B5** as a visual backbone, and incorporated additional **meta features** like **image color mean** and **aspect ratio**.  
   The final solution integrated multiple techniques to enhance generalization and robustness:  
   - **5-Fold cross-validation** with early stopping  
   - **Meta feature fusion** into the classification head  
   - **Stage 2: Knowledge Distillation** with soft labels from the best fold model  
   - **Softmax ensemble averaging** across fold models  
   - Applied **mixed precision training**, **gradient clipping**, and **cosine annealing learning rate scheduling**  
   Final private leaderboard position: **88 / Private Leaderboard**  
   Final score: **0.14587** (98 submissions)  
   Team name: `Human_SexyBoys` | Members: '황순기', '유순곤', '이한빈'

-  [**Kaggle March Madness 2025 Submission**](https://github.com/Sungi-Hwang/kaggle-march-madness-2025)  
  End-to-end pipeline for predicting NCAA outcomes by combining **XGBoost margin prediction**,
  **GLM-based team quality estimation**, and **spline-based probability calibration**.
  Enhanced model generalization by **merging men's and women's tournament data**, and improved prediction calibration through **custom spline post-processing**.
  Key techniques included **cross-validation, ensemble averaging**, and **feature engineering** based on historical statistics. <br>
  Final leaderboard position: **393/1727**
  
-  [**Korean Crime Statistics Analysis**](https://github.com/Sungi-Hwang/KCrimeInsight)  
  An end-to-end data pipeline analyzing Korean crime trends across 12 years (2011–2022) using population-normalized rates  
  and user-defined crime classification. The project includes:  
  - **Automated data collection** from KOSIS Open API  
  - **Custom classification** of crime types (e.g., violent, theft, sexual, gambling)  
  - **XGBoost regression modeling** for crime rate prediction  
  - **Interactive visual analytics** via Flask + Plotly  
  Focused on uncovering **inter-crime correlations** and **regional crime trends**, this tool provides insight for future  
  policy evaluation and prediction tasks.
