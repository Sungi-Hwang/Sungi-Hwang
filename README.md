## 🔗 Projects  
- 🏀 [**Kaggle March Madness 2025 Submission**](https://github.com/Sungi-Hwang/kaggle-march-madness-2025)  
  End-to-end pipeline for predicting NCAA outcomes using XGBoost, GLM, and spline-based probability correction.  
  Improved model generalization by **merging men’s and women’s data**, and enhanced calibration through **custom post- 
  processing**. <br>
  Final leaderboard position: **397/1727**
  
- 🕵️ [**Korean Crime Statistics Analysis (2011–2022)**](https://github.com/Sungi-Hwang/KCrimeInsight)  
  An end-to-end data pipeline analyzing Korean crime trends across 12 years (2011–2022) using population-normalized rates  
  and user-defined crime classification. The project includes:  
  - **Automated data collection** from KOSIS Open API  
  - **Custom classification** of crime types (e.g., violent, theft, sexual, gambling)  
  - **XGBoost regression modeling** for crime rate prediction  
  - **Interactive visual analytics** via Flask + Plotly  
  Focused on uncovering **inter-crime correlations** and **regional crime trends**, this tool provides insight for future  
  policy evaluation and prediction tasks.
